	abstract = {A quasitoric manifold (resp. a small cover) is a 2n-dimensional (resp. an n-dimensional) smooth closed manifold with an effective locally standard action of (S 1) n (resp. (2) n) whose orbit space is combinatorially an n-dimensional simple convex polytope P. In this paper we study them when P is a product of simplices. A generalized Bott tower over , where or Ê, is a sequence of projective bundles of the Whitney sum of-line bundles starting with a point. Each stage of the tower over , which we call a generalized Bott manifold, provides an example of quasitoric manifolds (when) and small covers (when Ê) over a product of simplices. It turns out that every small cover over a product of simplices is equivalent (in the sense of Davis and Januszkiewicz [5]) to a generalized Bott manifold. But this is not the case for quasitoric manifolds and we show that a quasitoric man-ifold over a product of simplices is equivalent to a generalized Bott manifold if and only if it admits an almost complex structure left invariant under the action. Finally, we show that a quasitoric manifold M over a product of simplices is homeomorphic to a generalized Bott manifold if M has the same cohomology ring as a product of complex projective spaces with É coefficients.},

@article{Choi&Masuda&Oum,
	abstract = {We completely characterize real Bott manifolds up to affine diffeomorphism in terms of three simple matrix operations on square binary matrices obtained from strictly upper triangular matrices by permuting rows and columns simultaneously. We also prove that any graded ring isomorphism between the cohomology rings of real Bott manifolds with $\mathbb Z/2$ coefficients is induced by an affine diffeomorphism between the real Bott manifolds. Our characterization can also be described in terms of graph operations on directed acyclic graphs. Using this combinatorial interpretation, we prove that the decomposition of a real Bott manifold into a product of indecomposable real Bott manifolds is unique up to permutations of the indecomposable factors. Finally, we produce some numerical invariants of real Bott manifolds from the viewpoint of graph theory and discuss their topological meaning. As a by-product, we prove that the toral rank conjecture holds for real Bott manifolds.},
